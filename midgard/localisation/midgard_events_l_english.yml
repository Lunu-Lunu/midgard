 geri.1.t:0 "Attack on Marxin"
 geri.1.desc:0 "This morning, during the early parts of the morning sermon, an unexpected snowfall began over Marxin. At first, it was written off by many as just that: an unexpected snowfall. However, it quickly became clear that this assumption was incorrect, many arcane detectors being set off throughout the city's defenses as soldiers wearing white and teal conducting an assault on the city, coming out of the sewers, abandoned buildings, and flying in on wyverns. After several hours of fighting on the streets, the forces sent by Ymir Niflheim were fended off by the city garrison, but the damage left by the attack is still clear, as many buildings lay in ruin."
 geri.1.a:0 "How could we let this happen?"
 geri.2.t:0 "On the Topic of a Military Attache"
 geri.2.desc:0 "After meeting with top military officials within Geri, multiple options for military co-operation have been determined. The choices are as follows: The Minotaurs, notable for possessing hands nearly in equal flexibility to that of us humans', which we hope would streamline the process of creating new and effective weapons for humans to wield. The Riverponies, specifically those of the River Republic, who offer minds more in leaning of extensive military planning, and the Griffonians, who in turn have learned the ways of lightning warfare from the Changelings."
 geri.2.a:0 "The Minotaurs are the natural choice."
 geri.2.b:0 "The Riverponies present an unexpected discipline."
 geri.2.c:0 "The Griffons present a unique opportunity."
